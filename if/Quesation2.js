// Quesation2.	The area of a rectangle is 96 cmÂ². If the breadth of the rectangle is 8 cm, find its length and perimeter.  

let area = 96;
let breadth =8;

let length = area / breadth;

let perimeter = 2 * (length + breadth);

console.log("Length of the rectangle is: " + length + " cm"); //Length of the rectangle is: 12 cm
console.log("Perimeter of the rectangle is: " + perimeter + " cm"); //Perimeter of the rectangle is: 40 cm
